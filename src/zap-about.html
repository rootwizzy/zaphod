      <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
      <strong>tl;dr -  Intrinsic drive to create and improve technology, systems and workflows. Strong teamwork and leadership values formed from a base of effective communication.</strong>

      <p>
        Technology and computers have always been staple in my life, mostly in part to my dad's passion and career in technology. It was this curiosity of the digital world that landed me my first computer on my Fisher Price table and from there I was hooked.

      <p>
        Tinkering on computers was not my only hobby growing up either, in both high school and college I played Football. I found myself attracted to the comradery of the sport. Being part of a group of people, all working for a singular goal and the challenges it presents has been an experience worth the long days and bruises.

      </p>

      <p>
        Now in the workforce I can see how these experiences are not mutually exclusive. Whether it's working directly with a client, a small group of developers or a large organization, you are part of a team working towards a goal.
