      <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
      <strong>tl;dr -  I am inherently driven to create and improve all types of technology, systems and workflows. I have a broad experience working as a part of a team, whether leading or following.</strong>

      <div class="about">
        <div class="about_description">
          From a young age, I have been immersed in all things technological, mostly in part to my dad's passion and career in technology. It was this curiosity of the digital world that landed me my first computer on my Fisher Price table and from there I was hooked.

        <div class="about_description">
          I didn’t spend my entire life inside on a PC. I participated in football on the offensive line for (8) years of high school and college. I am attracted to the comradery of a team. While in high school I was a standout on the team and received conference honors. However in college, I found myself playing a supporting role, not a starring one. The experiences were different (the bruises were the same), but each taught me the value of teamwork – whatever the role.

          <div class="highlights_item-title">Implemented Agile Work Flows</div>
          <div class="highlights_item-description">Working with a small development team with an ever increasing number of projects we needed a more structured development cycle. After researching Agile development I began to rework our Git work-flows standardizing branches, issues, commits and pull-requests. Along with these changes we formed our Sprint cycles managing user-stories and stand ups as part of our daily development tasks. </div>

          <div class="highlights_item-description">Documentation is an important keystone in open-source projects, for both the source code and for the practices and systems employed by the community. Totem-Lodestar was my attempt to encompass this into one extend-able product that could quickly deployed across multiple projects.</div>

          <div class="highlights_item-description">Development projects that I have been involved with began with the Ruby on Rails (API) and Ember.js (Client) as our stack. Using these tools over the course of old and new projects provided the experience of maintaining and upgrading systems as these tools and practices were expanded on. Our projects are used either directly in the educational field, or used by those involved with education. For more information about these projects see <a href="/projects">Projects.</a></div>
